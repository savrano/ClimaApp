# Clima App

Clima App gives you instant weather information of the place you want and uses your current location information to show the weather at your location.

In this project, I used many kinds of technology. These are protocols and delegates, extensions, MVC design pattern, networking with URLSession, as well as  parsing JSON Data.

If you want, you can register for free and get instant weather information from https://openweathermap.org/
